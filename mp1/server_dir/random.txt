I'm sorry for dragging you all the way
I just hope you didn't think I'm mad or so
Just take a breath, make yourself
'cause there's something you may not imagine since you closed your eyes

But it's nothing scary, nothing to be afraid of
It's more like a taste of a breeze from the south
Might be crunchy in the morning and bright in the night
You can get it, I believe you did?

Now concentrate

Can you hear all the things around your knees?
Rabbits hop, waterdrop, whole reflection of yourself
Feeling dizzy of the spectacle

Lalalala-lala, life is everchanging
Nananana-nana, not so entertaining

Nothing to care, nothing to lose and no need to hesitate

Play like you never did before
Grab the beauty of the world
All the joys and wonders you might be wanted to
But you never knew that even exist

Here's everything you're looking for
There's no reason to be shy
Just spread the wings of possibilities on your back and fly

I don't know, go random

Play like you never did before
